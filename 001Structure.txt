Sure! Here is a basic "Hello, World!" program in Java along with an explanation of each word and token:

`public class HelloWorld` 
   `{`
   `public static void main(String[] args)` 
   `{`
      `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`
   `}`
`}`

> Explanation

*1. public*
- Keyword: An access modifier that means the class or method is accessible from other classes.
- In Context: Here, public means the HelloWorld class and the main method can be accessed from outside the class.

*2. class*
- Keyword: Used to declare a class.
- In Context: Declares a new class named HelloWorld.

*3. HelloWorld*
- Identifier: The name of the class. Class names in Java typically start with an uppercase letter.
- In Context: The name of the class we are defining.

*4. {*
- Symbol: An opening brace that marks the beginning of the class body.
- In Context: Indicates the start of the class definition.

*5. public*
- Keyword: An access modifier for the method.
- In Context: The main method is public so that the Java runtime can execute it.

*6. static*
- Keyword: Indicates that the method belongs to the class, not instances of the class.
- In Context: The main method is static, so it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

*7. void*
- Keyword: Specifies that the method does not return any value.
- In Context: The main method does not return any value.

*8. main*
- Identifier: The name of the method. The Java runtime system starts executing a program from the main method.
- In Context: The entry point of the program.

*9. ( and )*
- Symbols: Parentheses used in method declarations to contain parameters.
- In Context: main method accepts a single parameter String[] args.

*10. String[] args*
Parameter: An array of String objects. Used to pass command-line arguments to the program.
In Context: Allows the program to receive arguments from the command line.

*11. {*
Symbol: An opening brace that marks the beginning of the method body.
In Context: Indicates the start of the main method definition.

*12. System*
Class: A predefined class that provides access to the system.
In Context: Refers to the standard output and input streams, among other things.

*13. .*
Operator: Used to access members of a class or an object.
In Context: Used to call the out object from the System class.

*14. out*
Field: A static member of the System class. Represents the standard output stream.
In Context: Refers to the standard output (console).

*15. .*
Operator: Used to access members of a class or an object.
In Context: Used to call the println method from the out object.

*16. println*
Method: A method of the PrintStream class. Prints a line of text to the standard output.
In Context: Prints the specified string followed by a newline.

*17. ("Hello, World!")*
Arguments: The string "Hello, World!" passed to the println method.
In Context: The text to be printed to the console.

*18. ;*
Symbol: A semicolon that terminates the statement.
In Context: Marks the end of the println statement.

*19. }*
Symbol: A closing brace that marks the end of the method body.
In Context: Indicates the end of the main method definition.

*20. }*
Symbol: A closing brace that marks the end of the class body.
In Context: Indicates the end of the HelloWorld class definition.

> Summary

- public class HelloWorld { ... }: Defines a public class named HelloWorld.
- public static void main(String[] args) { ... }: Defines the main method, the entry point of the program.
- System.out.println("Hello, World!");: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
